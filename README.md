# Hey. So, I made you something.

You know me, I get these crazy, middle-of-the-night ideas. And this was one of them. I was thinking about all of our moments—the big ones, the quiet ones, the ones that feel like a secret only we know—and I just felt this overwhelming need to... build a place to keep them. A little corner of the world that was just for us.

So I did. I wrestled with code and searched for the perfect words (which is harder than it looks!) and poured every bit of what I feel for you into these pages. This whole website is my attempt to bottle up that feeling... like that one Tuesday afternoon, or that song that came on in the car, or the look you give me across a crowded room.

This is a living, breathing gift. It's for you.

### A Few Little Secrets About This Place...

As you look around, here are a few things I built in, hoping you'd find them:

*   **The Soundtrack:** I picked out a song that I think feels like us. You can play it using the little **speaker icon** in the corner. It's there if you want it.
*   **A Blank Page For You:** "The Archer's Notebook" is your own private journal. Anything you write there is saved *only* on your device. It's your space, for your thoughts. A real blank page, just for you.
*   **The Memory Finder:** If you're ever trying to remember that one thing I said that made you laugh, I made the **search bar** for that. Just type in a word or a feeling, and hopefully, it'll pop right up.
*   **The Time Machine:** On the "366 Days" page, a **calendar icon** will show up. It's a little time machine that can take you to any day of the year.

Anyway. I could go on forever, but I'd rather you just go and explore. This was my way of trying to show you how I see you. All the bright, beautiful, and complicated parts.

Happy Birthday. I hope you love it.

*Yours,*
